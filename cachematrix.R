## Functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## rather than computing it repeatedly

## Function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has 
## already been calculated then cacheSolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
